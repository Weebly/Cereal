A `IdentifyingCerealType` is a type that can be encoded and decoded using any of Cereal's non-generic encode and decode

at runtime through types registered with `Cereal.register(_: IdentifyingCerealType)`. 

By using runtime types you can encode protocol types instead. For example, if you had a protocol `Fooable` that inherited
from `IdentifyingCerealType`, you could encode an array of `Fooable` types; each a different concrete type that is then
determined at runtime.
